Al - Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the Syrian border . [ This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come . ] DPA : Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad . Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior ! The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI , so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s . The third was being run by the head of an investment firm . You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets . The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad districts of the capital . Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells , I don't do n't find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful . It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam . Al - Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul . The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings . On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home . In Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated .
